# DJBrickBreaker

Inspired by my friend DJ to create this brick breaker game. All in 100% vanilla JS. that's pretty much it. 

Say Hi To DJ by breaking all the bricks

If you clone the repo, in order to play ```cd``` into ```html-folder``` and run ```open main-board.html```

Note: this is version one, the game might not be fully centered on all screens, but with practice, you will develop the abillity to predict where the walls are. Evolution really is an amazing thing, aint it?
